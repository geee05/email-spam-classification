# email-spam-classification
This project comprehends the classification of emails as spam or not. By identifying undesirable and unsolicited emails, we can stop spam from infiltrating users' inboxes and enhance user experience. NLP concepts are applied to tokenise the data and process it in usable format for the model to be able to perform the classification.
